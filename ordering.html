<h1>Ordering</h1>

<p>The first step is to send your script (it can be sent in parts if you are still working on it) to me at davidguest[at]proofreading.website with any deadlines clearly recorded. After that I will assess your script so that you will know how long I need. This will give you a clear and fixed estimate of the cost of the work.</p>

<p>I will then send a sample of your proofread work for your approval attached to the email containing the offer. Once the offer has been agreed, then the fees should be paid.</p>

<p>The fees will cover also feedback which I consider essential.</p>
