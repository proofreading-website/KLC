<h1>Rates</h1>

<p>My fees are currently £22 or €26 per hour for proofreading and editing. Usually I can proofread about 2500 words per hour. Simple proofreading can be much faster if the script is already at an advanced stage. Most scripts I receive are within the 2000 to 3000 words per hour. However, some scripts require extended and time-consuming work. It is for these reasons that I always assess the work before starting so that the writer knows in advance what the charge will be.</p>


<p><i>Standard service</i>: £22 or €26 per 2500 words (approximately)</p>

<p>Let me know your deadline to avoid anxieties about lateness. If your deadline is very near, 

it is possible to prioritise your work. In that case there will be an extra charge as other work 

will be set aside. </p>

<p><i>Faster service</i>: Next day service costs £35 (€45) per 2500 words (guaranteed 10000 per day)</p>
