<h1>Rates</h1>

<p>My fees are currently £12 or €15 per 1000 words for proofreading and editing. Simple proofreading can be much faster if the script is already at an advanced stage. Most scripts I receive are within the 2000 to 3000 words per hour. However, some scripts require extended and time-consuming work. It is for these reasons that I always assess the work before starting so that the writer knows in advance what the charge will be.</p>


<p><i>Standard service</i>: £12 or €15 per 1000 words.</p>

<p>Let me know your deadline to avoid anxieties about lateness. If your deadline is very near, 

it is possible to prioritise your work. In that case there will be an extra charge as other work 

will be set aside. </p>

<p><i>Express service</i>: Next day service costs £20 (€25) per 1000 words (guaranteed limit: 10000 per day)</p>
