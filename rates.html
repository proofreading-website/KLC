<h1>Rates</h1>

<p>My fees are currently £22 or €26 per hour for proofreading and editing. Usually I can 

proofread about 2500 words per hour. Simple proofreading can be much faster if the script 

is already at an advanced stage. Most scripts I receive are within the 2000 to 3000 words 

per hour. However, some scripts require extended and time-consuming work. It is for these 

reasons that I always assess the work before starting so that the writer knows in advance 

what the charge will be.</p>
